# EllPHi â€“ a fast ellipse-tangency solver for anisotropic persistent homology
<img src="https://github.com/t-uda/ellphi/raw/main/ellphi-logo.png" alt="ellphi-logo" width="256" />

**EllPHi** brings anisotropy to persistent-homology workflows.

Starting from an ordinary 2-D point cloud, it estimates local covariance, inflates **ellipses** instead of balls, and feeds the resulting *tangency distance* into your favourite PH backend (HomCloud, Ripser, and so on). The result: cleaner barcodes, longer lifetimes, and ring structures that survive heavy noise â€” all without rewriting your topology code.
